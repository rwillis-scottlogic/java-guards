# java-guards
A Java port of a C# fluent guard clauses library.

This port of my existing C# code found at https://bitbucket.org/RowanWillis/guards was developed in order to learn Java by translating some existing code.

The library aims to provide an extensible fluent interface for writing guard clauses. A similar syntax was achieved in the Java implementation, but without the extension methods that are heavily used in the .NET implementation, the result is somewhat less easily extensible. I intended to investigate Porject Lombok's extension methods to resolve this in future.
